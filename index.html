            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a part-time Starbucks Barista since September of 2019. I am class of 2018 High school graduate, but before graduating high school I became a mother in February of 2018. I was still capable in graduating on time and graduating in the A/B Honoral. My hobbies are learning how to fix or build things but nothing is better than napping. As I always like to say my spirit animal is Sloth, they are not lazy! They just save a lot of energy and that is exactly what I do when I get the chance to nap. When I am not napping I will play and invest time with my daughter and when it is her nap time I get the opportunity to work on my Coding homework. I chose to take a leap of faith to learn how to code so I can invent a program for produce not to rot when it is in your fridge. I would go more into depth but I also do not want it to blow out of cover for my invention, but thank you for reading about me. I hope you enjoyed the little details of myself and maybe you will be having my program for your produce.</p>
